# 0x0C. Web server

In this project, some of the tasks will be graded on 2 aspects:

- Is your web-01 server configured according to requirements
- Does your answer file contain a Bash script that automatically performs commands to configure an Ubuntu machine to fit requirements (meaning without any human intervention)

For example, if I need to create a file /tmp/test containing the string hello world and modify the configuration of Nginx to listen on port 8080 instead of 80, I can use emacs on my server to create the file and to modify the Nginx configuration file.
